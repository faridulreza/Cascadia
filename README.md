# Cascadia

Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats & wildlife of the Pacific Northwest. Designed by Randy Flynn for 1-4 players.

In Cascadia, players compete to create the most diverse Pacific Northwest
environment as they draft Habitat Tiles and Wildlife Tokens to construct
a beautiful landscape mosaic. Each game of Cascadia features unique
combinations of scoring objectives linked to each of the five wildlife species.
While arranging wildlife into the point scoring patterns, players will also be
competing to create the largest contiguous habitat corridors. As players
build out their environments they must pay careful attention to the
habitats they create and the wildlife they populate them with, for the
goal of creating the most harmonious ecosystem in Cascadia.
